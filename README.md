# Interpin : an algorithm to predict intrinsic terminators

Interpin is an algorithm designed to predict intrinsic transcription terminators in bacterial genomes. 
We have already created a database with the same name, where predictions from 12745 bacterial genomes are placed. It can be found at  [Interpin db](http://pallab.cds.iisc.ac.in/INTERPIN)

This document provides an easy installation guide for our algorithm. It can be used to make predictions for a single genome as well as run parallely on multiple genomes.

# Pre- requisites
## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```
    
## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a PhD student in the field of Computational biology at the Computational and Data sciences department, Indian Institute of Science.
I work with genomic data and find interesting patterns in them. I then try to find the underlying principles for those patterns.
I have worked with protein, RNA and DNA sequences, structure and annotation.
